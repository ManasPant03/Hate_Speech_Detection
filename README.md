# Hate Speech Detection

The following project is a project on the classification of speech in 3 types that are hate speech, offensive speech or non-hate or non-offensive speech.
For further details on the project go through the report of the project and have a look at the ppt.
Also, i created the "model.py" file just for an initial purpose to understand the code without the interface so you can ignore it. The main and full project resides in the "application.py" file.
